## What works
- Blink
- Pinmappings
- Upload via BMP
- Debugging via BMP
- USB as Serial Console
- LoraWAN OTAA Join and Tx Data

## Next steps
- Supply a Pull request to be able to configure Beelan externally (see /include/config.h)
- Low Power
- Use Security Chip
- Sensors
- Measure Battery State
